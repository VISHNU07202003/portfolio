                        I'm a first-year MS Computer Science student with a passion for building intelligent systems 
                        that solve real-world problems. With a perfect 4.0 GPA, I've been diving deep into machine 
                        learning, distributed systems, and scalable application development.

                    <p>
                        My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity and a desire to create impactful solutions. 
                        From developing federated learning frameworks that preserve privacy across thousands of clients, 
                        to building CNN-based computer vision systems for real-time road monitoring, I thrive on challenges 
                        that push the boundaries of what's possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest developments in AI, contributing to 
                        open-source projects, or designing intuitive user experiences. I believe that great technology 
                        should not only be powerful but also accessible and user-friendly.
